Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

#Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game
This is a clone of the famous arcade game _frogger_.

##How to run the game
Launch the game by running the index.html file located in the game folder.

##How to play
The game starts as soon as you launch the game. Your goal is to get to the water on the other side of the map while avoiding the beetles zipping across the screen.

###Controls
You move your character by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Each key will move the player character one space in that direction.

###How to win
Moving to the end of the map brings you to the next round. There are a total of three rounds, and you only have a total of 5 chances to pass the third and final round before you lose.
